This is my capstone project at App Academy. It is a real-time polling app that you can use, for example, while making a presentation or teaching a class. Your audience can respond to your question(s) using SMS text messages and/or voting via their web-enabled devices (tablets, laptops, desktops, or mobile web browsers).
