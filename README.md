This is my capstone project at App Academy. It is a real-time polling app. Your audience can respond to your question(s) using SMS text messages and/or voting via their web-enabled devices (tablets, laptops, desktops, or mobile web browsers). The poll results are displayed in a chart that is updated in real-time as votes come in.
